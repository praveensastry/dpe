# Clustering example

This example showcases unsupervised clusterization with [K-Means].

We use the [iris flower dataset] which consists of 50 samples from
each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris
versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the
length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Data
are in [iris.csv](iris.csv).

We train an unsupervised clustering model on numerical features,
and check the predicted data (cluster number) against dataset label
to evaluate performance.
