# Adult dataset

Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also
known as "Census Income" dataset.

Imported from [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

The dataset is split in multiple CSV files (less than 512 kB) with headers, so:

- file schema and features may be automatically extracted
- programs operate on multiple partitions, as on large datasets
- individual files can be loaded and formatted within the browser
